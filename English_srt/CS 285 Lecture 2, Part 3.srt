00:00:01,325 --> 00:00:03,746
So, In the next part of this lecture

2
00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:13,443
I want to present a short case study, for a paper that actually does imitation learning.
In kind of clever way for a real world robotics task.

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:20,471
so this is a paper called a machine learning approach to visual Perception of Forest Trails for mobile robots

4
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:25,314
and in this paper, their goal is to get a quadrobot to fly through a forest.

5
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:28,981
so let’s start by playing back their video.

6
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,113
So here’s an illustration of their quadrobot that’s going to be flying through a forest

7
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:39,127
and their goal is to train quadrobot with an imitation learning with algorithm

8
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,715
so in some ways it’s kind of similar to the driving paper that i showed before

9
00:00:44,596 --> 00:00:47,604
and now there are a few challenges to overcome.

10
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:51,219
We need to be able to actually collect data to train the system

11
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:59,966
and we need to address that stability issue right because if you remember this the in general we would get compounding errors due to distributional shift

12
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:08,563
and we need to somehow address them either with a principled approach like dagger or with a more heuristic approach that takes care of the issue in practice.

13
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:18,707
Now, the way that they actually frame this problem is a classification problem,
so we’re going to have discrete actions going left right and straight

14
00:01:18,757 --> 00:01:24,024
and here, they’re going to talk about how they solve the problem. three classifications, three possible labels.

15
00:01:26,457 --> 00:01:28,520
So where does the data come from?

16
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,022
well... flying a quadrobot for a long time?

17
00:01:31,102 --> 00:01:33,574
it’s pretty tricky because it runs out of batteries.

18
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,753
so what they’re actually going to do is they’re going to try to collect that data with a person.

19
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:43,019
they’re going to have a human actually walking around collecting data

20
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:47,003
and that’s going to be used to train this classifier. It's a deep content classifier.

21
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:52,283
yes it has many layers, many weights, many everything that’s great and wonderful.

22
00:01:53,992 --> 00:01:55,405
So how is it going to trend.

23
00:01:55,875 --> 00:02:05,144
(showing movie)

24
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:11,368
there we go,  there’s the illustration now many of you can probably guess at this point what’s going on

25
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:13,474
Why are there three cameras?

26
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:18,967
Well, I think you can kind of guess at this point a kind of similar idea as in that driving paper.

27
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:25,834
the left is initially classified as right,
the right image will be classified as left,
and the forward image will be classified as straight

28
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:32,138
so then you can go for a nice walk in swiss countryside, and use that to train up your quadrobot

29
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:42,334
and then we can fast forward and see what it does in practice so this here you can see at the bottom the probabilities that they’re classifiers assigning to left and right terms

30
00:02:42,582 --> 00:02:44,296
data from a person

31
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:47,352
and here’s a quadrobot.

32
00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:00,539
okay so that’s a quick case study on imitation learning
